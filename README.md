This repository is deticated to all the C projects that are a part of my Computer Science 121 - Program Design and Development C/C++ class at Washington State University (Spring 2024). This repository includes programming assignments, auizzes, and labs. By no means are any of these solutions the best or the most elegant, however, they are intended to be here in order to show growth in my programming ability and as review for this computer science course.
